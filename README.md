# face-tracking_candy_launcher
Utilized OpenCV for face tracking and a time-of-flight sensor for precise motion tracking. Gained hands-on experience with microcontrollers (Arduino, STM32), electrical components, and motor control. Designed and implemented a system to track and launch projectiles accurately at moving targets, enhancing real-time interaction and control accuracy.
